<h2 title="EDITORIAL">American Missionary Association.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<p>The next Annual Meeting of the American Missionary Association will
be held at Providence, R.I., commencing at three o’clock Tuesday
afternoon, October 23d. Rev. Arthur Little, D.D., of Chicago,
will preach the sermon. On the last page of the cover will be
found directions as to membership and other items of interest.
Fuller details regarding the reception of delegates and their
entertainment, together with rates at hotels, and railroad and
steamboat reductions, will be given in the religious press and in
the next number of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>.</p>

<p>A meeting of great interest is expected, and we trust our friends
will make their preparations in due time to be present.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Our Receipts</span> for the ten months ending July 31st are
$235,884.73, an increase of $6,377.40 as compared with the
corresponding months of last year. The increase from collections is
$12,628.92, and the decrease from legacies is $6,251.52, leaving
the net increase as stated. This increase from collections is
gratifying; but our expenditures during the last ten months have
been $27,079.89 greater than for the same months last year.</p>

<p>This increase has been due not only to the imperative demands for
the enlargement of the work, but to the added facilities afforded
by the contributions of friends who have realized these needs and
have provided the necessary buildings and improvements.</p>

<p>The patrons of the Association have been wont to rally in the
month of September to save us from debt. Our average receipts from
<em>collections</em> for that month for the past three years have
been $38,000, which is nearly double the average of our monthly
collections for the past year. We hope our friends have not lost
their zeal in our work, and that their hearts are as warm and their
hands as liberal as ever.</p>

<p>We ask their attention to the two items that follow:</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h3><i>A Practical, Thoughtful Man.</i></h3>

<p>A gentleman once said to a Secretary of this Association: “I
contribute regularly to all our Congregational societies, and in
addition to that I lay aside $100 for the society that stands
in the greatest need. I notice that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</a> one or the other of these
societies comes to the close of its fiscal year threatened with
debt, and this year I think the American Missionary Association
must have the $100.”</p>

<p>Thanks were duly expressed.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h3><i>A Creed.</i></h3>

<p>We believe that there are many such practical, thoughtful men in
our churches who lay by money, some more, some less, for this good
purpose.</p>

<p>We believe there are many more Christian people, who, while they do
not plan so definitely, yet keep watch of the benevolent societies,
and come to the rescue in time of need.</p>

<p>We believe that some give out of their abundance, and others,
feeling themselves somewhat straitened yet realizing the
difficulties of a benevolent society in like circumstances, decide,
in the spirit of Christian self-sacrifice, to aid with their mite
the embarrassed society.</p>

<p>We believe there are pastors, devoted and efficient in their parish
work, who yet are broad-minded and large-hearted enough to keep a
watchful eye on the interests of the great missionary societies,
and, at the appropriate time, to urge upon their churches liberal
contributions for the hour of need.</p>

<p>We believe that, at this time, the American Missionary Association
is the society needing special help at the close of its financial
year, and we earnestly exhort practical, thoughtful Christians and
churches to make special remembrance of our wants by prompt and
liberal contributions during the month of September.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> begin this month the publication of a series of letters
received from students or graduates of our various institutions in
the South. They will be found very readable. Those of our friends
who begin the one we publish in this number will read it through,
we are very sure, and will be glad to read the others as they come
in successive numbers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">How brief</span> the passage from life to death. This number of
<span class="smcap">The Missionary</span> contains a very interesting sketch of the
Commencement exercises at Talladega College, written by Mrs. L.
A. Orr; and yet, on another page, will be found the record of her
death. Happy are they who are toiling in the Master’s vineyard when
the summons comes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with Rev.
G.&#160;D. Pike, D.D., for nearly twenty years. We knew that his studies
ran beyond the range of official work, but we never suspected that
he indulged in writing verses. Since his death, several hymns have
been found, written by him, and,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</a> on another page, we present one
of these. It was written during his absence for his health and when
he regarded the end of life as not far off, and indicates his faith
and hope. The many friends of Dr. Pike will be glad to read this.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">
<h3>MR. MOODY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Moody as a lay evangelist has made a marvellous, a unique,
record in modern Christian labors. No layman, and few clergymen,
have surpassed him in this peculiar work. But Mr. Moody’s efforts
in another line are attracting the attention and admiration of
Christians in all parts of the world. We venture the prediction
that one hundred years hence Mr. Moody will be better known by
the schools he has founded than by the evangelistic work he has
done. There is something about a permanent institution, like the
opening of a living spring on the hillside, that is refreshing
and perennial. John Harvard and Elihu Yale opened such fountains.
Other men of to-day are doing the same thing in the South, either
by the consecration of permanent funds or the founding of permanent
institutions. May their number be multiplied.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">
<h3>AFRICA.</h3>

<p>Alas for poor Africa! The day of her redemption lingereth. The
rebellion of the Mahdi hindered the progress of civilization in
the vast regions of the Upper Nile. It occurred precisely at the
time that Rev. Dr. Ladd was making his explorations near the mouth
of the Sobat, with a view to the establishment of the Arthington
Mission. The hope that was entertained that this sudden and
disastrous outbreak would soon be quelled has been disappointed.
The Mahdi is dead, but he has a successor, Khalifa Abdullah,
who, if he does not inherit the Mahdi’s remarkable powers, yet
can suffice to keep the Soudan in turmoil. Emin Bey has not been
rescued and Stanley’s whereabouts and safety are uncertain. Is
it not time that the duty of the American of African descent to
the land of his fathers should be pressed upon him, and that the
Christian church should help to prepare him for that duty?</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">
<h3>THE SIOUX BILL.</h3>

<p>The friends of the Indians have sought earnestly and successfully
to secure proper legislation looking to the civilization of the
Indians. The Dawes Bill and the Sioux Bill have been hailed with
joy as important steps in this direction.</p>

<p>But Senator Dawes himself and other intelligent friends of the
Indians have foreseen the possible difficulties in the way. The
refusal of the Indians<a class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</a> to sign the treaty at the recent council
at Standing Rock, and the indication at this writing that the
same refusal will meet the Commissioners at the Cheyenne, Rosebud
and Pine Ridge Agencies, present the picket lines of these
difficulties. But beyond all these lie the stronger hindrances.
The great trouble is that the Indian is still an Indian, in his
ignorance, his want of training for civilized life, his dislike
of work, and his incompetency to make profitable use of the lands
and teams and implements proffered to him. Of what use to any man,
white or Indian, is 160 acres of land if he doesn’t want it, if he
doesn’t know how to use it, and can’t make a living on it? After
all that has been said and done, the thing that the Indian needs
is a <em>Christian education</em>. If he has that, he will know how
to work and will be inclined to work, and will become a good and
self-supporting citizen. Christian friends of the Indian! rally to
the great work of Christianing these Indians. The primer and the
New Testament are their great want.</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">
<h3>THE MOUNTAIN WORK AND THE COLORED PEOPLE.</h3>

<p>There are three things which give special emphasis to the
importance of pushing forward the “Mountain Work.”</p>

<p>1. The great material, intellectual and spiritual destitution of
the more than two million people of our Southern mountains—a
people of good natural endowments, who respond readily to the
life-giving impulses of a pure gospel—is the thing which appeals
most directly to our sympathy.</p>

<p>2. Many well-informed business men are confidently declaring that
this is the richest mineral region of the world. Already they are
either building or planning railroads through every part of the
mountains, which are made profitable not only by the wonderful
mines which open at their approach, but also by the great forests
of black walnut, poplar, and other valuable timber. This, of
course, means that the present primitive condition of things cannot
long remain. It must give way to something else. Whether it shall
be to godlessness and wickedness of every form, or whether the
natural religiousness of the people shall be met with pure and
uplifting gospel influences—with the Church and the Christian
school—depends in a large measure on what our churches and
individual Christians say through the treasury of this Association.
What will take years of work and thousands of dollars in the future
can now be done in months and with hundreds.</p>

<p>3. But this work has a connection with our other Southern work
which has been little noted. These mountains extend down into the
very heart of the South, in a territory 200 miles broad and 500
miles long. In the late war, the people were loyal to the Union
almost to a man, and thousands of them fought for its preservation.
Slaves were few among them, and colored people are now scarcely
more numerous than they are in the North, though the proportion
is increasing. The result is a natural affiliation with<a class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</a> what
are known as “Northern Ideas.” The feeling against a Christian
treatment of the colored people is neither so bitter nor so
deep-rooted as elsewhere in the South. It has been demonstrated
that no-caste churches and schools can be established and
maintained, and the general sentiment of the whole region can, by
vigorous missionary work, be moulded to the Christian view.</p>

<p>The people of this region—vivified and developed, intellectually
and spiritually, on the broad basis of Congregational Christianity;
believing in, and practicing, the doctrine that all men were
created free and equal and should have equal rights in all
public matters; and, in their new and fast-increasing commercial
importance, in constant contact with other portions of the
South—would furnish an unanswerable argument against the fears of
the Southern white people with reference to the amalgamation of
the races, and other direful results, which would follow a just
treatment of the colored man. “And seeing the man which was healed
standing with them, they could say nothing against it.”</p>

<h3>EMANCIPATION IN BRAZIL—WHAT IS TO FOLLOW?</h3>

<p>It is a curious fact that, in precisely the last fifty years,
slavery has been abolished by the four great nations holding the
greatest number of slaves and representing the three great forms
of the Christian religion—the Protestant, the Greek and the Roman
Catholic.</p>

<p>Thus England, a Protestant power, emancipated her slaves in the
West Indies in 1838; Russia, of the Greek Church, freed her serfs
in 1861; the United States, a Protestant nation, emancipated her
slaves in 1863; and now, Brazil, a Roman Catholic empire, completes
the circle by emancipating her slaves in 1888.</p>

<p>While these facts are remarkable, and present cause for profound
gratitude to God, there is yet a lesson of vital importance to be
learned which Brazil needs to understand, and which, indeed, the
other nations are not fully practicing.</p>

<p>In the British West Indies, very few white people remained after
emancipation, and the blacks lacked their guidance and example; and
besides this, it was years afterwards before the British Government
made any adequate provision for the education of the ex-slaves.
From these two causes have come nearly all the evils that have
grown out of the emancipation.</p>

<p>Russia presents a still more striking lesson. In 1861, as the
result of a great national movement towards constitutional liberty,
her fifty millions of serfs were emancipated. The next year, she
celebrated the thousandth anniversary of her national existence,
and the enthusiasm for a free government was intensified. But all
these hopes were dashed—no new constitution was given, the Czar
ruled autocratically as before, the serfs were not educated or
enfranchised, and largely sunk into ignorance and intemperance.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</a>
The result of all has been nihilism, and the Czar lives in hourly
fear of death, and rules his people by terror, the prison and
Siberia.</p>

<p>The United States has done far better. It enfranchised the slave
and made him a citizen; the National Government, through the
Freedmen’s Bureau, expended several millions of dollars for his
education; the States organized public school systems, and the
benevolent people of the North rendered still more effective
service, being the first to introduce the work, acting always, when
permitted, in co-operation with the Bureau and with the States,
and continuing its work, blending the educational largely with the
religious. But in spite of all this, a dark cloud gathers on our
horizon—the blacks are not allowed the free enjoyment of their
guaranteed rights, and the facilities for educational and religious
enlightenment are entirely inadequate. Three millions of the
blacks of ten years of age and upward, in 1880, could not write.
America needs not only to ponder these facts, but to act upon them
promptly, if it would avert the impending danger.</p>

<p>In these facts Brazil should read her warning. If her ex-slaves
are left in ignorance and vice, she has her work only begun, and
the last end may be worse than the beginning. The laws of Brazil
have favored gradual emancipation. It was the work of a woman that
completed it. In the absence of the Emperor, who was sick in Italy,
his daughter, as Regent, issued the final decree.</p>

<p>May we not hope that the womanly wisdom and philanthropy which
dictated the initial act may prompt to the persevering use of
the means of the last great duty? And may we not hope that, as
thousands of the educated women of the North devoted themselves
to the uplifting of the blacks in the Southern States, so their
sisters in Brazil may give the crowning glory to emancipation in
Brazil?</p>

<h3>INTER-BLENDING OF MISSIONARY WORK.</h3>

<p>The great London Missionary Conference, recently held, awakened
much enthusiasm on the spot in behalf of foreign missions, and we
believe that the published records and addresses will intensify
and perpetuate that salutary influence. The Christian world needs
arousing to the great work of the church in heathen lands.</p>

<p>There is, however, an inter-blending in all parts of missionary
work that should never be overlooked. The home field is the source
of the means, and men, and prayers, that must energize the work
in the foreign field. Dead churches at home cannot give life to
mission work abroad.</p>

<p>There is another form in which the home and foreign fields are
blended. The American Missionary Association is ranked, and
properly, as a home missionary organization, but it has its
relations to the foreign field.</p>

<p>1. It is called to train the Freedmen of America for mission work
in Africa. White men meet a speedy death in malarial Africa, and
they come to the natives as strangers. The Freedmen can better
endure the climate of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</a> their fatherland and will be welcomed by the
people as brothers. We believe that the great problem of African
evangelization is destined, in the providence of God, to be largely
solved by the ex-slaves of America.</p>

<p>2. The Indians of the United States have been ranked heretofore as
coming under the work of foreign missions. At one time the American
Board had the largest share of its work among these people. Other
Christian denominations so classed their Indian missions, in part,
at least—and all this properly, for the mass of the Indians are
still heathen. The day will come when the Indian will be lost in
the man, and then gospel work for him will be home or parish work.
But at present the American Missionary Association is doing foreign
mission work in the home field, among these Indians.</p>

<p>3. The Chinaman in America, like the Negro in America, is cultured
and Christianized here very largely for the sake of China. He comes
here not to stay, but to go back to the home of his fathers. Now,
if we don’t stone him, or mob him, but imbue him with the gospel,
he goes back home as a missionary. A specimen of the spirit in
which he returns can be seen in the touching letter from a Chinese
convert in another column of this magazine. The Hong Kong Mission,
established under the auspices of the American Board, and to which
our converted Chinamen on the Pacific Slope contributed both men
and money, is an illustration of the way in which the American
Missionary Association touches the foreign field in China.</p>

<p>4. Last, but not least. The battle against caste must be fought,
and the victory won, in America. As the last battle against
slavery was fought and won here for the world, so we must fight
the battle of caste here for India as well as for America. Fifty
years ago very wise and good brethren said: “You Abolitionists
are right <em>theoretically</em>, slavery is wrong and ought to
be abolished immediately; but <em>practically</em> you are a set
of visionaries. Slavery is a local institution, and if you wish
to push your denominational interests in the South, you must
establish your churches there and let the question of slavery
alone.” We have lived long enough to hear these brethren confess
their mistake. There are wise and good brethren now that say:
“<em>Theoretically</em>, caste is all wrong, but it exists and can’t
be overthrown, and if you wish to press your denominational work in
the South, you must ignore that question and plant your churches
on the color line.” Somebody will live to hear those who take
this position confessing their mistake. The American Missionary
Association stands now on the caste question just where it once
stood in regard to slavery. It will neither dodge nor compromise,
and will plant schools and churches in the South, if at all, openly
and avowedly disregarding class distinctions. It makes no effort to
bring the races together, yet any man, woman or child, otherwise
qualified, will be welcomed to its schools and churches, even if
God has made him black. In waging this warfare in America, it is
doing a Christian missionary work against caste in heathen nations
of the old world.</p>

<h3>SCHOOL ECHOES.</h3>

<p>Question.—“When and how long did Solomon reign?”</p>

<p>Answer.—“10,000 years before Christ. He rained forty days and
forty nights.”</p>

<p>Question.—“Susy, can you tell me what I read to you about
yesterday?”</p>

<p>Answer.—“Christ and the twelve opossums.”</p>

<p>In Mississippi, one of our teachers taught her class faithfully the
golden text, “Put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place
whereon thou standest is holy ground.” The next Sunday, only one
girl could remember it, and she recited it thus: “Moses, Moses,
take off them shoes.”</p>

<p>The colored preachers of the old time, in selecting their
illustrations from Bible characters, are wont to give them a
strongly imaginative turn; as for instance when one, in a long
story of Abraham’s trial in offering up Isaac, represented him as
“going along, holding on and not making any fuss during the journey
by day, but at night when Isaac was not by, as praying and crying
all night.”</p>

<h4>ENGLISH AS SHE IS WRITTEN BY INDIAN STUDENTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The Races.</span>—They are five races, which are the white and
yellow, and black and red and brown. The yellow race likes to eat
rat, and the black race likes to eat man, and the white race likes
to eat frog, and the red race likes to eat buffalo.</p>

<p>The Caucasian is the strongest in the world. The semi-civilized
have their own civilization, but not like the white race.
The savage race kept their own ways, and they have had three
occupations: they were hunted, fished and foughted to the other
people. They beat, too. The white race have three occupations:
agriculture, manufacturing and commerce.</p>

<p>The white people they are civilized; they have everything, and go
to school, too. They learn how to read and write so they can read
newspaper. The yellow people they half civilized, some of them know
how to read and write, and some know how to take care of themself.
The red people they big savages; they don’t know anything.</p>

<h3>EXTRACT.</h3>

<p>We do not print the extract given below because it has our
approval, but because it is taken from a newspaper published by
colored men, and is significant.</p>
</div>

<p>We have yet to learn that unless we organize for self-protection
and make use of our organization, we shall continue to be used as
foot-balls, and a target for infuriated white mobs. Unless we take
active and aggressive measures for our safety, we shall continue to
receive treatment which should not be administered to the beasts
of the field. We do not believe there should exist one law for
the white man and one law for the black man, as<a class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</a> there exists in
the South to-day. We are all sovereign citizens, and should be
protected by the laws alike. The present dispensation of the law
in the South is an infamous outrage, and is unworthy of a great
country like ours.</p>

<p>What is the remedy for this state of affairs? History shows that
sooner or later oppressed people arise from their lethargy, and
take by force that which is denied them by the laws of their
country. What we need to do, is to organize such societies
as the one so earnestly advocated by the editor of the late
<em>Freeman</em>, and use such societies for the enforcement of the
law and the obtaining of our rights when they are denied us.</p>

<p>The colored people of this country need not expect that their white
fellow-citizens are going to aid them in this struggle, so we might
as well put our shoulder to the wheel, buckle on our armor and
go forth to the conflict with stern faces and undaunted courage.
Blessings never come to those who recline upon the indolent couch
of ease and wait for them; the honors of this life do not come
unsought; a tree planted does not grow to maturity and produce
abundant fruit unless nurtured and cared for until it is able to
withstand the changes of the seasons. So with our condition in this
country. As long as we remain silent while our rights are being
filched from us, we may expect a continuance of this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Let us organize ourselves into a powerful and extensive
organization and then we shall be in a position to make a
systematic and aggressive, as well as harmonious, struggle for our
rights. If we do this, we shall command the respect of all men,
even if we fail in obtaining what we struggled for. But we shall
not fail. Truth and justice sooner or later triumph, if those who
champion them are only true to themselves.</p>

<h3>DEATH OF MRS. L.&#160;A. ORR.</h3>

<p>In the rest and quiet of vacation, death has come to the little
band left at Talladega.</p>

<p>On July 15th, Mrs. Orr passed suddenly away from earth. The day
before, while riding with a friend, the horse stumbled, and falling
forward pulled her out of the buggy to the ground. It was not
supposed she was seriously hurt, but later it was found that the
fall had produced concussion of the brain. In about two hours she
became unconscious, and lay in that condition through all the hours
of the night. At 9:30 on Sabbath morning, without a word or look
of recognition, she passed away. Thus has ended a most useful and
consecrated life. She was president of our W.C.T.U., and none
will be more missed. Tired teachers ever found a warm welcome, rest
and quiet in her pleasant rooms, and guests of the college will
remember with gratitude Mrs. Orr’s careful thoughtfulness for their
comfort.</p>

<p>Leaving a pleasant home at the North and remunerative occupation,
Mr. and Mrs. Orr came into this missionary work with but a single
aim, that of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</a> doing good, and nobly has it been accomplished.
By their efforts, mission schools in two out-stations have been
established and funds obtained for a school and church in one,
to be called Clinton Chapel in honor of the donors, most of whom
lived in Clinton, Mass. Mrs. Orr visited these schools. Her
personal presence cheered and encouraged them, and she gave from
her own means with no unsparing hand to further the work. The
death of their friend brings great sorrow to the people of these
neighborhoods, and they are greatly cast down. “Shall we have to
give up our new chapel?” and “What can we do without Mrs. Orr?” are
questions asked on all sides.</p>

<p>Dear friend! God help us to more faithfully and prayerfully carry
on the work you have laid down.</p>

<h3>NOTES IN THE SADDLE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. C.&#160;J. RYDER, DISTRICT SECRETARY.</p>

<p>The Sunday-school work of the A.M.A. has always been an important
element of that work. The rapid development of this department
within the past few years has been somewhat remarkable. Our
friends expressed grateful surprise at the Portland meeting that
the statistics were so exceedingly encouraging along this line.
“The total Sunday-school enrollment, as it appears in the Annual
Report of 1882, was 7,835, but we are able to report this year an
enrollment of 15,109, an increase in five years of 7,274, or nearly
100 per cent.,” was the very satisfactory showing as given in the
last Annual Report.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</a></p>

<p>Two interesting bits of history have recently come to me, which
indicate that the Sunday-school work of the Association is
developing with still greater rapidity and success. Reports were
gathered from twenty-two of the students of Straight University,
New Orleans, who taught school during the summer vacation. These
students were not so busy with their work in the day-school
as to neglect their duty as Christians in the organization of
Sunday-schools. They were scattered throughout Louisiana and
Mississippi, and reached many needy fields. They reported the
following facts:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
  <td class="pad">Number of pupils in the day-schools which were taught by them</td>
  <td class="ramt">1,398</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Number of Sunday-schools organized</td>
  <td class="ramt">13</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>These students were superintendents or teachers in</td>
  <td class="ramt">22</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Number of scholars in these Sunday-schools</td>
  <td class="ramt">1,574</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Number of hopeful conversions to Christ</td>
  <td class="ramt">168</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Five Bands of Mercy were organized with a membership of</td>
  <td class="ramt">181</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Four Temperance Societies were formed with a membership of</td>
  <td class="ramt">241</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These facts furnish us excellent evidence of the judicious and
enthusiastic efforts of these colored students to save and elevate
their own people. <em>Fifteen hundred and seventy-four</em> children
gathered into Sunday-schools, most of whom were absolutely
unreached before, by these twenty-two under-graduates of a single
A.M.A. school!</p>

<p>It is not strange that the President of Straight University, in
giving these facts, adds, with evident satisfaction:</p>

<p>“If a complete record could be made of all the work done in one
year even, by past and present members of our school, or any of the
A.M.A. schools, it would make an aggregate most wonderful.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Turning now to the progress of Sunday-school work in our great
Mountain field, we find the same remarkable development. Calvary
Congregational Church was organized at Pine Mountain, Tenn., Nov.
26, 1887, with thirteen members. The following striking facts are
just reported as the results secured in the past few months by the
energetic Christian workers in this church. Sunday-schools have
been established in the following places, with the enrollment given
below:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
  <td class="pad">Calvary Church Sunday-school enrolled</td>
  <td class="ramt">142</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Shiloh Sunday-school enrolled</td>
  <td class="ramt">127</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>New Prospect Sunday-school enrolled</td>
  <td class="ramt">68</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Lick Creek Sunday-school enrolled</td>
  <td class="ramt">78</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>making a grand total of 415 children and young people gathered into
these Sunday-schools on the mountain, and only <em>ten pupils</em>
of this whole enrollment <em>had ever been in Sunday-School
before</em>!! Another school is soon to be formed in this
neighborhood. This “Pine Mountain” field is about 20 × 60 miles,
and the little church which the A.M.A. built during the past few<a class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</a>
months is the only framed “church house” in the whole region. Think
of it, O Christian friends, you who hold the Lord’s money in trust,
1,200 square miles, with cabin homes scattered along every “cove”
and fertile valley, left, to this year of our Lord 1888, with only
one suitable place of worship!</p>

<p>In building this new church, the people themselves have strained
every nerve and made large personal sacrifices. They have had the
occasional services of the General Missionary of the A.M.A. for
that locality, and I visited them once when Field Superintendent.
They have also been assisted from the A.M.A. treasury, but they
have labored in season and out of season themselves in order
to establish this splendid work. The rapid development of the
Sunday-schools is not the only feature of this work that merits our
attention. One member of this church has distributed during the
year 424 new Bibles and 145 second-hand Bibles. He has visited 500
families personally. He found that 60 per cent. of these people
were without the Word of God in complete form. A few had mutilated
copies of the Bible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are hundreds of fields in the Mountain Work of the A.M.A.
just as needy and just as hopeful as Pine Mountain. All the facts
indicate that God has now opened this field to us. An intelligent
mountaineer said to me, some months ago: “Our great and only hope
lies in the A.M.A. and the Congregational churches of the North.”
Surely these churches will not disappoint this hope, nor refuse to
heed the voice of God speaking to them in all the stirring events
of this Mountain Work.</p>

<h3>THE BUSY WORKERS.</h3>

<p>The hive of the American Missionary Association in the South
has no use for drones. The bees are at work summer and winter,
and they improve not only the “shining hour,” but have to be
busy in rainy days as well. One of our workers who has long
been in the field, and who deserves to be kept there still
longer, writes as follows in accepting re-appointment:</p>
</div>

<p>I most cheerfully accept the work for another year, and to show you
that it means work for me I will just give you my programme for
the past two weeks: A rough ride two weeks ago this <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>
to the top of the mountain, and then on foot down the mountain
to Spring City, to take the night train for Lexington. Got into
Lexington Wednesday morning in a rain. Looked at this and that
piece of property during Wednesday and Thursday, it raining most
of the time. Came back Friday to Helenwood. Made some calls on
Saturday and preached at night. Preached at 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> next
day, and walked eight miles to Robbins and preached at night. Got
up at 3 o’clock and walked four miles to catch a train that would
stop at Glen Mary. Reached Spring City for breakfast at 6:30. Came
up home and answered what letters I needed to, and went back to
Spring City to stay all<a class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</a> night. Took train at six o’clock Tuesday
morning for Sunbright. Rode out to Deer Lodge. Made four pastoral
calls, walking four miles to do it, and was ready for an eight-mile
ride in lumber wagon, Wednesday morning, in the rain to Mt. Vernon
to deliver the oration of the day. Went back to Sunbright next
morning and found your letters of the 3rd. Went to Emory Gap that
evening. Walked out two miles in mud to see Bro. Clark. Came back
to Sunbright Friday, so as to reach Deer Lodge for a church meeting
that night. Made some calls Saturday morning, and then walked three
miles to call on a Congregational family that ought to unite with
our church here, and came back to preach at night. Taught a lesson
in Sunday-school next morning, and preached. Walked to Sunbright,
seven miles, and preached at night. Got up at 2 o’clock to walk
seven miles to Glen Mary to take the early train to reach home and
attend to correspondence so I can get off to Crossville to-morrow.</p>

<p>I do not always have it put on quite so thickly as this, but it is
a pretty fair average.</p>

<h3>TALLADEGA COLLEGE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MRS. L.&#160;A. ORR.</p>

<p>Talladega College has just passed its eighteenth annual
Commencement which, in many respects, was the most successful ever
held.</p>

<p>The exercises began on Thursday night, June 7th, with an exhibition
in the chapel by the second and third grades of Cassedy School,
followed on Friday by exercises in the Primary Department, and
at night by an exhibition by the fourth and fifth grades of
Cassedy School, all of which reflected credit upon the teachers
in charge. To many of our Northern friends, these may seem a very
insignificant part of Commencement exercises, but to these parents,
who consider all school work a failure which does not close with an
exhibition, and who will travel miles to hear their children “say
their pieces,” they are a very important part. At these exercises
the chapel was crowded almost to suffocation, the hall and windows
were full, and many went away, as they could not find even standing
room.</p>

<p>On Sunday, in the absence of Pres. DeForest, the baccalaureate
sermon was preached by Rev. J.&#160;M. Sturtevant, D.D., of Cleveland,
Ohio, and was full of rich thought and practical suggestions.
At night, Rev. G.&#160;M. Elliott, of Selma, preached an excellent
missionary sermon, very helpful to the students who go out into the
dark places to labor among their people.</p>

<p>The mornings of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were occupied with
public examinations in the different departments, and they all gave
evidence of faithful work having been done by teachers and pupils.
The examinations in theology and moral philosophy were especially
fine, and would do credit to any Northern white students.</p>

<p>Monday night was given to the exercises of the three literary
societies<a class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</a> connected with the college and these were conducted
wholly by the students.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon was the inspection of the industrial classes,
printing office, barns, &amp;c. In the large airy sewing-room were
samples of work done by the girls, including quilts, garments of
all kinds, and some very neat darning. In the printing office
several young men were engaged in type-setting, presswork, etc.,
and the neatness of the printed programmes testified to the good
work done by the “college press.” Visitors to the Slater shop
found the blacksmith at his forge, the painter, the glazier and
the cabinet-maker busy at work, and the wonder was that one small
shop could accommodate so many trades. The brick masons were laying
the foundation for an addition to the building, which will give
better facilities for work. The fine stock on the farm, the new and
improved farming tools, the steam engine in operation, and neat
barns, attracted many visitors.</p>

<p>A lecture at night by Dr. Sturtevant, on the subject “Manners,”
closed a very busy day.</p>

<p>Thursday was Commencement and the fullest day of the week. First
came the graduating exercises; the class numbered seven, three
young women and four young men from the Normal Department. Next
came the alumni address and essay, after which the treasurer gave
a brief statement of the resources of the college. The increase in
attendance as compared with last year was more than eighty.</p>

<p>At the alumni dinner, in Foster Hall parlor, were present the
alumni, the Faculty, and friends from the North, South, East and
West, to the number of seventy in all. After supplying our physical
wants, next in order came the toasts and responses. Dr. Andrews was
master of ceremonies and in response to the toast “Our Theological
Work,” Rev. Spencer Snell, of Birmingham, spoke of the great need
of an educated ministry among the colored people, and told an
amusing story of the “call to preach” of a colored man. He was at
work in the field, but soon got tired, and leaning on his hoe,
he said to himself, “Dis hoe am <em>so</em> heaby, an’ dis row am
<em>so</em> long, an’ dis sun am <em>so</em> hot, I tink dis nigger am
called to preach de gospel.”</p>

<p>Next Paul Bledsoe of Laredo, Texas, spoke for “Our Normal Work,”
James Brown for “Our Students,” and Mr. Stephen Childs, of Marion,
for the “Parents of our Students.” Rev. J. Silsby, of Tenn., who
was personally acquainted with the early history of the college,
responded to the toast “The Founding of Talladega College.” “Our
Churches” was responded to by Rev. C.&#160;B. Curtis, of Selma, and J.
R. Sims, of Shelby Iron Works. Dr. Andrews closed with a few words
for the college.</p>

<p>At night, W.&#160;P. Hamilton and J.&#160;A. Jones, who were graduated from
the theological department in 1887, were ordained to the work of
the gospel ministry. This closed the exercises of the week. During
the week, many kind words were spoken for the college by friends
from different parts of the State, showing that the best colored
people in the State appreciate the thorough work done here.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</a></p>

<p>During the week President DeForest was very much missed, but we
all hoped that what was our loss would be his gain in health and
strength from his trip across the ocean.</p>

<h3>TRINITY SCHOOL, ATHENS, ALA.</h3>

<p>Another year of pleasant work has just closed. Teachers and
students, though looking rather worn and weary, are in the happiest
mood, for all feel it has been a <em>good year</em>. The latter
part of this school year has been specially characterized by very
earnest study, and an ambition to reach one hundred per cent.
in every thing. <em>One</em> student has done this with a single
exception, and says that he “shall surely make that up during
vacation.” All have attained a higher standing than usual, and our
final examinations were excellent.</p>

<p>Our sending a class to Fisk University this year, with favorable
reports of them coming from month to month, has proved a constant
inspiration to our classes here, and we hope as the years go by, to
send many more in the same direction.</p>

<p>But the great struggle with us is to hold our students long enough
to take them through even an elementary normal course. Parents in
their ignorance and extreme poverty, are in such <em>a hurry</em>
to have their children teach and earn money to help support
the younger ones, that, as soon as they can get a third grade
certificate to teach in the public schools of the State, they are
supposed to be <em>educated</em>.</p>

<p>And, too often, the people in the rural districts, impressed with
the wonderful attainments of the young teacher, add to the folly
of the parents in making these young people themselves, (only the
weaker ones), think “they know enough, without going to school any
more,” and so they drift into the ranks of those who “think they
are something, when they are nothing.”</p>

<p>This is one of our discouragements, but we have very much for our
encouragement in the beautiful <em>homes</em> that are springing
up all over this fair South-land, and in the noble band of
intelligent, consecrated, Christian workers who, in pulpits and
school-houses, and in the conscientious and successful management
of business, are leading their people to a higher plane of living
and to a truer citizenship.</p>

<p>Our closing exercises were held on Monday night, May 28, our
twenty-third anniversary. Our large and beautiful hall was
packed as never before. The audience was appreciative and very
enthusiastic. There were visitors from Birmingham and Decatur, and
all the towns along the lines of railroad. They expressed great
interest in what they saw and heard, promising to send us many new
students in October; but the difficulty is to find suitable places
for them to board, as the parents all prefer to have their children
in the Institution under the constant supervision of teachers.</p>

<p>Our exercises were quite novel, and had some unique features
that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</a> greatly pleased the patrons. In all that was attempted, the
pupils acquitted themselves well, and the <em>little</em> children
especially pleased the patrons of the school in their beautiful and
perfect Scripture recitations. All the Sunday-school Golden Texts
from October to June, were recited without a mistake, also several
Psalms and an entire chapter from Isaiah. Bible truth planted in
the hearts of these young children, will, we trust, bear precious
fruit in their future lives.</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>HOW I WON MY SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MR. W.&#160;B. ROSS.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1881, I left Fisk University in search of a summer
school. Knowing nowhere else to go, I went to the southwestern
part of Arkansas. I had been informed by a Fisk student that there
were vacancies in Hempstead county, and thither I bent my way in
company with two other young men, also seeking summer employment,
both of whom opened subscription schools in the State. I had taken
two lessons a day in Latin during the school year just ended, and
expected to “double my Greek” the next year. This would necessitate
my being in at the beginning of the school year. I had always been
politically inclined, and so had studied almost every artifice to
win among strangers.</p>

<p>We three rode from Hope, Arkansas, to Washington, a distance of ten
miles, in an old-fashioned ambulance.</p>

<p>On arriving at Washington, we were taken to the house of the
colored teacher of that place. I looked at him; he extended his
hand; I explained our business, and immediately he volunteered to
assist us.</p>

<p>I had a particular school in view on leaving Nashville. On arriving
at Washington, I learned from Mr. Shepperson, the teacher referred
to, that one of the trustees of that school was in town.</p>

<p>I immediately started out in search of him. In a short time I was
presented to a stoutly-built, heavy-set man, who was introduced as
the gentleman I desired to see. I forthwith explained to Mr. Holt,
for such was his name, that I had been informed that there was a
colored school to be taught that summer in his district, and that I
had come hoping I could get it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “there is a school there, but it will be a month
before it can open.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said I. “I don’t see what I’ll do. Have you any
objections to its being opened now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; if the colored people are willing, I am,” said he.</p>

<p>But I could see in the tone of his voice something that showed an
unwillingness to have the school begin before Mr. Holt’s cotton
was worked out. However, I took him at his word, and set out in
the hot sun and sand, with<a class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</a> my satchel on my back, to the desired
plantation. On the way, I saw two million lizzards, one billion
spiders, and a trillion scorpions, to say nothing of tarantulas
and centipedes that appeared in countless numbers along my path.
I arrived at Mr. H.’s house about six o’clock in the evening, and
proceeded immediately to the cabin where the colored people lived.
Finding no one at the cabin, I went to the field.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said I to an old colored lady.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’,” said she.</p>

<p>“I am from Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn. I have come out here
to teach this school for you.”</p>

<p>“Whar’s ’Fesser Thomson?” said she.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where the Professor is, but I’ll teach for you. My
name is Ross.”</p>

<p>“Yas, sah.”</p>

<p>“And your name?”</p>

<p>“Daffney.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Daffney, will you show me how to find the rest of the colored
people in this settlement?”</p>

<p>“Yas, sah. Go down here and cross yonder, and you’ll come to a big
field and some trees, sah.”</p>

<p>Before leaving Nashville, I put on my best. I knew, in case of any
difficulty, my clothes would be an important factor in obtaining
success. I went to an old colored man, plowing in that field,
opened my duster, showed him my nice coat and shirt-stud, at the
same time telling him, as fast as I could, whence I came, my
object in coming, and reading the Fisk catalogue to let him learn
something about the school.</p>

<p>He seemed satisfied with me. His countenance had changed from its
troubled appearance to a pleasant one. But for ten minutes we
argued the possibility of a cotton crop being made there if school
opened then. I made point after point, but could not convince
him, so put out after his wife. She was readily convinced of the
desirability of having school open immediately; she promised to
send three children, and to turn the old man.</p>

<p>I next encountered Jack Davis. “If you open school now, we’ll
starve next winter,” said he.</p>

<p>I tried to show him differently, but was unsuccessful. I asked him
for a drink. On reaching the house for it I explained my mission
to his wife, and obtained her consent to open the school, with her
promise to send two.</p>

<p>I next met a man who had no children to send. When I showed him
the picture of Fisk University (Jubilee Hall), he immediately
volunteered to work for me. He and I went and saw nearly every man
in the community before 9 o’clock that night.</p>

<p>The majority were against me, but I had resolved to open school
there and then. Time would not permit me to delay longer. The
next day (Sunday) I was given a Bible class to teach in the
Sunday-school. To my<a class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</a> surprise, on going out doors I found that a
preliminary school meeting had been held under the trees and that
the Sunday-school teacher, though against me on coming there, had
changed and was marshalling his forces for the great meeting on the
morrow.</p>

<p>At 11 o’clock that same morning I heard a rousing blast by a
huntsman’s horn. On inquiring, I found that my childless friend was
telling the people to come together the next day. In the meantime,
Jack Davis came over and discussed the matter with me. He closed by
saying that I talked too fast for him, but that one thing was sure:
he would send no children.</p>

<p>I did a great deal of talking that Sunday; not willingly, but on
being introduced to the people as they came around to see me,
nothing was left but to discuss in full the question of opening.
It was an ox in the mire. Well, Monday came. The horn once more
resounded through the woods. The people gathered from far and
near. The chairman was elected, and, on stating the object of the
meeting, took occasion to show them the impracticability of opening
before the first of July. “There,” thought I, “whipped again. The
chair is against me.” I arose and spoke ten minutes. On taking my
seat, one opposed to me spoke. Among other things, he said: “Too
many rascals are out from school, anyhow.” Here one would rise
on my side; there one on the other side. Every man, including
myself, seemed to do his best to talk loud enough. The chairman
showed weakness in presiding, and was lacking in a knowledge of
parliamentary usage. Thought I, “here is my chance.” Every time
he blundered I arose and pointed out his error; showed him how to
appoint his committees, and instructed him as to what motions took
precedence. He saw my object, and informed me openly that he had
participated in conventions in Helena. “It makes no difference,”
said I; “you are wrong in your ruling.”</p>

<p>He began to look pitiful in the eyes of all. Men began to leave
the room. Soon one-half of them were on the outside. The tide was
turned. I went out to inquire more fully into matters. Nearly every
man was now for me. “Then, come in,” said I; “you can’t help me
out here.” I remained behind to see that all came. The previous
question, namely, to open the school on the first of June, was
called. All stood up in the affirmative except the man who had
seen the “rascals.” I had won through the chairman’s ignorance. I
have often thought of it since, and see more fully every day that
most battles are lost or won through incompetency on one side and
superiority on the other, and that knowledge is truly a power.</p>

<p>I will add that Jack Davis was my best friend after opening that
school, and Dick Brown, whom I met plowing on going from Aunt
Daffney’s house, carried my trunk a quarter of a mile for nothing,
and loaned me his watch while I taught there. On going away, the
man who was so afraid of the “rascals” came four miles to my house
and carried my trunk thirteen miles to Hope—all for nothing. The
crop turned out well. I gained twenty pounds, and, in a word, we
were all happy.</p>

<h3>SPEECH OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.</h3>

<p>At a Fourth of July celebration held at Lidgerwood, Dakota, a
novel feature of the exercises was a speech by Magayohi (Chief
Star), in the Sioux dialect, which being translated reads as
follows, and which shows that if all the Sioux Indians were as
intelligent and as well disposed as this chief, the Government
Commission would have little trouble.</p>
</div>

<p>“This land which lies about us was once the property of my people;
you have now possession of it and have made yourselves homes and
are rearing your families on the land which formerly belonged to
my forefathers. I have no complaint to make of this fact, for it
is perhaps better as it is. Our desire is to become like the white
man; to learn to cultivate the land and to make a living from it;
to learn to read and to write and to transact business; to learn
the principles of government and become citizens; to acquire title
to 160 acres for each member of our tribe. We have faith in the
Great Spirit and in the Great Father at Washington, and believe
that in time your people will teach my people to be like you; the
negro’s skin is darker than ours, and you have made a man of him;
we ask the Government to do us the same justice.”</p>

<h3>FORT YATES, DAKOTA.</h3>

<p class="secauth">FROM MISS M.&#160;C. COLLINS.</p>

<p>What are we going to do? This is a question coming to us
continually. The A.M.A. doubtless is in a happy mood and smiling
condition, now that it has strengthened our forces by two new
men—one, Rev. Mr. Cross, 300 miles below here, and one, Rev. Mr.
Reed, 32 miles from here at the Agency. It is a good thing—a great
deal better than not to have sent anyone. But now, think of it: An
Agency containing 6,000 souls, scattered in villages of from twenty
to fifty families in a village, and the settlements from five to
ten miles apart.</p>

<p>I could put a hundred Bibles in as many homes now among Catholics
and wholly heathen families where one, at least could read it who
has learned in some school of ours or the Presbyterians. I could
give out a thousand Dakota Primers, or First Readers, into as many
homes where they are anxious to read in their own tongue. There
is no law against a Dakota’s owning a Dakota Bible, nor reading a
Dakota primer in his own home. We could establish ten schools where
Sabbath services could be held, at once. We could so reach a great
many homes and hasten the civilization and Christianization of
these Indians by many years.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</a></p>

<p>I go long distances into Catholic houses as well as others, to
administer to the sick. Last night I had a Government teacher (a
Catholic) and his sick wife, whom I have been treating, and their
two children, here all night. I have been riding sixteen miles to
treat her, and then riding home, the man always coming for me and
bringing me back.</p>

<p>I have now given twelve years to this work. I have seen wonderful
changes. I have seen men with painted faces and feathers following
the leader on to darkness and death. I have seen the same men,
clothed and in their right minds, stand before a heathen audience
of their own people and heard one say, only last week, “Men and
brethren, you know me as a man fierce in war—a man whose hands are
stained with blood—a man bearing many wounds. My body still bears
the marks, but Christ has made me whole. I am another man. My body
is the same, but my heart is new. My soul is clean; my will has
changed; I think differently. The Gospel has renewed me.” It was
one of the grandest pleas for the Gospel I ever heard. O! will you
not empty your gold and your silver into the treasury? Will you not
advance, and take every post as fast as ready to surrender? Let
us guard these people with a great army of the Lord. Send on the
advance guard and bring up your reinforcements. <em>I</em> do not
want to fall till I see Dakota taken for the Lord!</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>CHRISTIAN CHINESE EN ROUTE TO CHINA.</h3>

<p>It is some of the experiences of our Chinese brethren on their
way to their native land that I have in mind in this title—not
the bare fact that they do so return, or that their presence in
their old homes cannot but become a leavening and a gradually
revolutionizing influence there.</p>

<p>The subjoined letter is of special interest only because it is a
little more full in its statement than others relating to other
voyages. The writer, Ng Hing, was brought to faith in Christ at our
Barnes Mission, and the letter is addressed to his teacher, Mrs.
H.&#160;W. Lamont. Ng Hing is a modern Nathaniel. I scarcely ever spoke
with him during the first months of his discipleship to Christ,
but I felt like repeating that greeting which Jesus gave to the
first Nathaniel: “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no
guile.” And I have found this impression abundantly confirmed by
the testimony of his brethren and my own closer acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>The letter is a little old, being dated Nov. 17th. When it was
first placed in my hands I asked the privilege of laying it before
the readers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, but it has been crowded out
till now. I give it with no attempt to set it right in its English.
It will be understood as it is, and will be read, I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</a> trust, with
all the more interest, revealing, as it does, the attempt of an
intelligent Chinese to wrestle with what must seem to him the
awkward idioms of our outlandish tongue:</p>

<p>
“<i>Dear Teacher</i>:
</p>

<p>“I am arrived here safely, Nov. 15th, Tuesday, at noon. I thank
you and Miss Lilian [daughter of Mrs. Lamont, and, like her
mother, one of our teachers] very much indeed for your lovely
present and the letter which you given me. I used to read it
very often because it is very improve to me, and that I know
the Lord Jesus has opened my soul-eye and raised me from the
death of sin to a life of righteousness. I will to tell all my
countrymen what great thing Jesus has done for me, just as much
as I can speak to.</p>

<p>“Now I want to tell you about our journey. We have met fifteen
missionary ladies and gentlemen. Some go to Japan and some to
China. And several Chinese Christian brethren were there, and
we have joined with the missionary to have service on every
Sunday morning. I am very glad we have so pleasant opportunity
on the ship—sing to praise God and spoke the gospel of Jesus.</p>

<p>“But on the Oct. 26th we meet a great tempest; the waves run
over the deck, and the wind against the ship, dreadful. That
made the Chinese heathen complain and say many wicked words
against us Christians; and they said to themselves, too: ‘We
must not allow these Chinese Christians have the meeting on
the ship because they tell us believe in Jesus and not worship
the idol and image; therefore the evil spirits made the wind
and the waves against the ship.’ Oh, I am very sorry for them,
so foolish, when I heard that. For we trust in God and know he
will take care of us, and even the tempest so great. God made
it peaceful, and carry us all to get through safely—never
drown. We should all thank God for his mercies and praise him
so great and so powerful. But the heathen not mind God and do
not care for their souls.</p>

<p>“The missionary was very kindly to them and pity them so
ignorant.</p>

<p>“On the 6th of Nov. Mr. Chalfant read Acts 17:24-30, and I read
it in Chinese and we try to explain it to them, but they were
very proud, and not want to hear the Gospel of Jesus. They
only crowd round us and make terrible noise, with revilings
and indignity to us. That was to be fulfilled the words which
Jesus had said to us Christians: ‘Ye shall be hated of all men
for my name’s sake.’ Well, no matter what <em>they</em> said; the
Bible says: ‘Love your enemies and do kindly to them that hated
you,’ and we know God will be with us and help us in trouble,
and even the heathen so persecuted us, but we do kindly to them
and pray for them. Now please pray for me, for the temptation
is great here; and pray for the missionary in China. * * * I
do not forget all your kindness to me. Let God bless you and
your family and all the scholars, and increase the number that
believe in Jesus our Saviour. From Your scholar,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Ng Hing.”</span>
</p>


<p>I have room for a sentence or two from Chin Toy at Sacramento, in
a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</a> letter just received: “The tracts and small books were duly
received. I was very glad for them. I think will do much good to
our people. Street meetings here every Sunday. I give out some of
the tracts at the end of the preaching. All hearers seemed very
glad to come and get them. Each one say, ‘Give me a piece.’ I trust
the Lord will bless the seed still growing, which were sown on
these ground. This school is better lately. Had five or six new
scholars come last week. The Christian brethren are all well and
attend the meeting regularly.”</p>

<p>And here is a little of the “shady side” in another field: “I found
these three brethren here not quite love each other. They too much
complained each other’s faults. I felt very sorry for them. I think
every one of them is try to do right, but they are all impatient;
that is the trouble. I visited some stores in Chinatown; invited
men to come to school. Some men told me many scholars stayed away
because the Christian boys quarrel. So I thought better write you
that you will pray for them on that matter. I told them we must
love and forgive each other, hold fast together in the bond of
peace, and serve the Lord with the pure heart, then we will bring
forth fruit.”</p>

<p>Sound doctrine, to which many a company of American believers would
do well to take heed, though it comes from the pen of one who once
sat in darkness and worshipped idol-gods!</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO.</h3>

<p><i>My Dear Miss Emerson</i>:</p>

<p>Having just returned from my class of Chinese children, my mother
thought, for the sake of variety, I might give an account of this
interesting though curious gathering. This class was formed about
three years ago. There was no Sabbath-school for Chinese children
at the time, and seeing the great need of one, and being unable to
attend to it on Sunday, I decided to have it on Friday afternoon,
at three o’clock.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of an hour before the time for commencing,
I start for the children, going from home to home, inviting and
coaxing them to come. I sometimes carry with me pieces of cake and
candy or a bright text-card to attract those who seem more timid
than the rest.</p>

<p>If I meet a stray child on the street, I say “Na lie dook she?”
(You come to school?) Sometimes my labors are rewarded by seeing
a bundle of clothes slip past me, and a minute afterward all is
lost in oblivion in a small alley; but sometimes they slip their
dirty hands into mine and trudge along with me, amid the jeers and
contemptuous smiles of those passing by. Finally we arrive at our
school room, between twenty and thirty children being present,
ranging all the way from five to twelve years. We commence by
singing three or four hymns; then all rise and repeat a prayer
after me in concert, sentence by sentence. I then explain the
Sabbath-school lesson through an interpreter, and either show the
picture of the International Lessons, or a black-board drawing, and
sometimes an object. I find, as with all children, their interest
can be awakened and held by means of an object or picture. After
letting each repeat the text given the week before, we close with
the Lord’s Prayer in Chinese; and after good-bye is said all
around, I dismiss them, taking some of them home, as their parents
are afraid to trust them across the car tracks alone.</p>

<p>These children are exceedingly bright and attentive, and as to
their good behavior, I can sometimes hold up their example as
worthy of the imitation of my class of American boys. Only to-day,
in speaking of the lesson on “Worshiping the Golden Calf,” I asked
which they worshiped, God or idols, and one little girl said, “Me
worship God; idols no good. They have eyes, no see; hands and
feet, and no walk.” And when I asked all to raise their hands who
would worship Jesus, she raised both hands. When shown the picture
of Abraham offering Isaac, one of them said, “Why did not he run
away?” One day, when taking home a little girl of five years of
age, she looked at the cable car which was passing, and said, “What
for does that car go faster than that one (pointing to a horse
car)? That has no horse.” They ask innumerable questions, and want
to know the why and wherefore of everything.</p>

<p>Oh! my dear Christian friends, pray for me, that I may be aided
in teaching and guiding these precious souls, on whom so much of
China’s progress depends.</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>LITTLE INDIANS.</h3>

<p>Perhaps there are little children in some of the beautiful homes
in the cities who cannot understand that the Indians are not all
born grown up, with feathers on their heads and tomahawks in their
hands. One little blue-eyed girl once said to me with a very long
O-o-o-o and her hand over her mouth, “Oh, o-h! I did not know there
were little Indian boys and girls!” but let me tell you, little
Golden Hair, there are Indian boys and girls.</p>

<p>They have some very funny names, too. But there is one thing
pleasant about it; their names are given to them because they mean
something. As I write this article, I look out from my window and
see an Indian boy with a roughly-made sled drawing his little
sister up the hill so that she can slide down again behind him.
Little Indians are not wholly unlike little white boys and girls.
They eat and sleep, laugh and cry, but they do not fight. That
comes with civilization.</p>

<p>I can from my window watch the boys and girls playing on the
hillside every day as long as the snow lasts, and I never have
heard a child cry nor have I seen one child hurt another. I can
hear them laugh and shout and cheer when one tumbles off the sled,
but no angry or bad words are ever used. They are very merry and
happy when we remember that there is no Indian child that does not
know what it is to be hungry and have the mother say there is no
food.</p>

<p>When a little baby comes into an Indian home, he is wrapped up in
a blanket and it is tied all about him so that he cannot use his
arms or legs, and he looks very much like a rag doll, but he cries
and laughs just like a real flesh and blood and bones baby. But,
little Golden Hair, let me whisper to you one secret of the Indian
baby’s happy life: he never gets <em>spanked</em>! They leave that to
the uncivilized white mother. So, after all, the white boy does not
have all the good in life; does he? Only think of sliding down hill
a whole morning without even a board between the smooth snow and
the trousers, going home with wet and worn clothes and not getting
whipped; not even sent to bed!</p>

<p>Indian children are never punished; but, after all, they are not
bad. The boys like to hunt the snowbirds with bows and arrows. They
kill a great many too. The little girls play with corn-cob dolls
and little tents and travois, or <em>toshoes</em>, as they call them,
sometimes drawn by dogs.</p>

<p>The Indian children have hard lives after all. They cannot live to
grow up unless they are pretty strong. A great many little ones
die for want of good, wholesome food, and many for want of fresh
air and warm clothes. We want all the little boys and girls in
Christian homes to remember the little Dakotas. There is much good
in them; and if they had the advantages you<a class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</a> have, perhaps they
would be fully as well behaved, and as true and faithful to God, as
are you. Will you help us to save the little Indians?</p>

<h4>LITTLE INDIAN CHILDREN IN THE BIRDS’ NEST AT SANTEE AGENCY, NEB.</h4>

<p>They are such happy little girls, and so easily entertained. Just
now I saw two of them getting such a merry time out of dragging the
bowl of a large pewter spoon over the ground for a wagon, putting a
little stick in the way to represent water they had to cross—for
our recent rains have flooded the bottom-lands in several places.
There was a nail lying in the spoon, and I asked what that meant.
“Oh,” Maggie said, “that is me, and I am going to the store to buy
some beads.” A shorter nail was there to represent her younger
playmate. No little girls to-day, pushing their red-cheeked wax
dollies in their miniature baby carriages, are any happier than
our little Indian girls, drawing their broken pewter spoon and
representing themselves by old rusty nails.</p>

<p>At our Missionary Society, which meets every Saturday for an hour,
I generally read them a little story; sometimes from “The Pansy,”
which was sent us last year, or from “Our Little Men and Women,”
also a gift from an unknown friend. They enjoy it always and like
to see the pictures; but the book that holds the charm, and of
which they never tire, is “The Story of the Bible.”</p>

<p>They have pieced two small quilts and one large one this season,
and will finish two others of medium size. Our mite box contains
$2.50 at this date. These are the pennies that their parents send
them to be used in this way, and occasionally they earn one by some
little service for us.</p>

</div>

<p class="center small">OF THE</p>

<p class="center"><b>AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION</b></p>

<p class="center small">WILL BE HELD AT</p>

<p class="center"><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I., OCT. 23-25.</b></p>


<p>Rev. Arthur Little, D.D., of Chicago, will preach the sermon.</p>

<p>The Meeting will be held in the Union Congregational Church, of
which Rev. J. Hall McIlvaine, D.D., is Pastor. The friends in
Providence have already begun preparations for the reception of the
Association.</p>

<p>Life Members and Delegates chosen by contributing churches, Local
Conferences, and State Associations, constitute the Annual Meeting,
as will be seen by the following article of the Constitution.</p>

<div class="medium">
<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Members of evangelical churches may be
constituted members of this Association for life by the
payment of thirty dollars into its treasury, with the written
declaration at the time or times of payment that the sum is to
be applied to constitute a designated person a life member; and
such membership shall begin sixty days after the payment shall
have been completed. Other persons, by the payment of the same
sum, may be made life members, without the privilege of voting.</p>

<p>Every evangelical church which has within a year contributed
to the funds of the Association, and every State Conference
or Association of such churches, may appoint two delegates to
the Annual Meeting of the Association; such delegates, duly
attested by credentials, shall be members of the Association
for the year for which they were thus appointed.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">So far as possible, the Providence churches will entertain those
who attend. Those purposing to be present and wishing entertainment
are requested to write to Rev. J. Hall McIlvaine, D.D., Providence,
R.I., Chairman of the Committee of Entertainment.</p>

<p>Special rates will be arranged at hotels for those who desire to
pay their own way. Railroad and steamboat favors will be secured as
far as possible, and notices of reductions and other matters will
appear later in this Magazine and in the religious press.</p>
